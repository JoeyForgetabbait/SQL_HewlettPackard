# SQL_HewlettPackard
## Overview 
Use PostgreSQL to analyze historic Hewlett Packard company employee data. First, use the HPdataengineering.sql to establish relationships between the data tables available, in order to build table schemas. Once the proper relationships between primary, composite, and foreign keys is built into the table schemas, subsequent data importation is done. Once the data is imported into the data base we created, analysis via SQL queries can be done with ease. Create summary tables with queries in the HPanalysis.sql file to analyze multiple angles of historical Hewlett Packard employee data.
